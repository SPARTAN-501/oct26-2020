# W01D03 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [x] Review primitive types
- [x] Objects!
- [x] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [x] Functions inside objects (using `this`)

### Primitive Types
* simplest form that data can be reduced to
* no properties (like objects)
* the actual value is stored in memory
* they are immutable

* strings `const myString = 'hello';`
* boolean true/false
* integers/numbers
* bigint
* undefined
* null
* Symbol

### Objects
* collection of key/value pairs
* has behaviour
* keys in an object are always strings

### Array
* collection of values (objects)
