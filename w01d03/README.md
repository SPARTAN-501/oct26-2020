# W01D03 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [ ] Review primitive types
- [ ] Objects!
- [ ] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [ ] Functions inside objects (using `this`)

### Primitive Types
* simplest form that data can be reduced to
* no properties (like objects)
* the actual value is stored in memory
* they are immutable

* strings `const myString = 'hello';`
* boolean true/false
* integers/numbers
* bigint
* undefined
* null
* Symbol
