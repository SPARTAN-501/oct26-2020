### To Do
- [x] HTTP and cookies
- [x] Render pages differently based on language preference

* HTTP is a stateless protocol
* Neither party (server or the client) is required to remember anything about previous interactions
* Cookies allow to preserve state between requests
* key/value stored in the browser (Chrome stored as a text file)
* domain and port specific
* Cookies are automatically sent to the server with EVERY request
